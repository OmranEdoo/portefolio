msgid "The TrailLove76200 project aims to visualise the trajectories of participants in the Oxfam Trailwalker 2021 race and to provide a spatio-temporal analysis of these trajectories. The main challenge is to find an effective way of visualising this data and providing analysis tools for race organisers and researchers interested in the data collected. To meet this challenge, the project proposes the development of a high-performance web application capable of representing the evolution of participant's pace as a function of different parameters."
